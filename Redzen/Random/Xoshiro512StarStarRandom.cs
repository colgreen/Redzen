// --------
//
// This is xoshiro512** 1.0, an all-purpose, rock-solid generator. It has
// excellent (about 1ns) speed, an increased state (512 bits) that is
// large enough for any parallel application, and it passes all tests we
// are aware of.
//
// For generating just floating-point numbers, xoshiro512+ is even faster.
//
// The state must be seeded so that it is not everywhere zero. If you have
// a 64-bit seed, we suggest to seed a splitmix64 generator and use its
// output to fill s.
