/// <summary>
/// wyrand pseudo-random number generator (PRNG).
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// Uses the wyrand PRNG defined at https://github.com/wangyi-fudan/wyhash.
/// This PRNG is based on multiplication of two 64 bit numbers to give a 128 bit result, which fast on x86
/// CPUs that have the BMI2 MULX instruction that can do this multiplication in hardware, otherwise the
/// multiplication is emulated but is still very fast.
///
/// This PRNG passes the BigCrush and practrand statistical tests, and is probably the strongest PRNG of those
/// currently provided in the Redzen library. Performance is comparable to xoshiro256** when the BMI2 MULX
/// CPU instruction is available, but perhaps marginally slower overall (on an AMD Ryzen 7 PRO 5750G), but not
/// by enough to really matter. If you require a high-speed non-cryptographic PRNG then this is a good choice
/// and probably preferable to Xoshiro256**.
///
